# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

#npm start

-> We tried to create a experiment using "jspsych" (https://www.jspsych.org) in the form of timeline and uses plugins to define what to do at each point on the timeline. In this experiment we have displayed random set of images from the Open Affective Standardized Image Set (OASIS) (WARNING: explicit content) in every fraction of seconds and are limited what number of images we have set.

-> Only issue we are facing is images we want to display are not shown for some reasons. We believe that is cause of image plugins.
